# Patreon PHP Example

An example of implementing the [Patreon PHP](https://github.com/1f991/patreon-php)
library to create a website that displays all of the Patrons of a Patreon
Campaign and automatically updates when a Pledge is created, updated or deleted.

You can find a live version of this example at
[patreon.1f991.com](https://patreon.1f991.com) where you can pledge to the test
Campaign to see yourself added in realtime, and you can follow the tutorial
below to set up this example with your own Campaign.

## Requirements

* A Web Server (such as [Wamp](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) or [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/) if you're developing on your own computer)
* PHP >=7.2.0
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
* A [Patreon](https://patreon.com) Campaign

## Getting Started

### Patreon Client

First you will need to create a Patreon API Client to obtain a Patreon
`Creator's Access Token`.

1. Visit [`Clients & API Keys`](https://www.patreon.com/portal/registration/register-clients)
  in the Patreon Platform Portal
2. Click `Create Client`
3. Fill out the fields and save — you don't need to enter real data
4. After your client is created you'll find your `Creator's Access Token` by
  clicking the arrow next to your Client

### Install Example Project

1. Open your terminal
2. Clone this project from GitHub into a directory called `patreon`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/1f991/patreon-php-example patreon
```

3. Change into the `patreon` directory:

```bash
cd patreon
```

4. Install the dependencies with Composer:

```bash
composer install
```

5. Open the newly created `.env` file and add your `Creator's Access Token`:

```bash
PATREON_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-creators-access-token-here"
PATREON_WEBHOOK_SECRET=""
```

You're now ready to visit your new Patreon PHP powered website!

### Setting up Webhooks

Your website will need to be accessible online for this step. You can use
[ngrok](https://ngrok.com) to expose a local website to the open internet during
development.

1. Visit [Register Webhooks](https://www.patreon.com/portal/registration/register-webhooks)
  in the Patreon Platform Portal.
2. Paste the URL to your Patreon PHP website and append `/webhook.php`, e.g:

```
https://patreon.1f991.com/webhook.php
```

3. Copy the Secret that is generated by Patreon
4. Open `.env` and add your `PATREON_WEBHOOK_SECRET`:

```bash
PATREON_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-creators-access-token-here"
PATREON_WEBHOOK_SECRET="your-patreon-webhook-secret"
```

You're all set! Patreon will now notify your website every time there's a new
pledge, a pledge is deleted or a pledge is updated, and your website will update
the local database.

You can test out your webhook integration with the helpful Patreon event tests.

1. Next to the `Create Pledge` event click `Send test`
2. Click `Send Test` again — you should see Patreon display `Test Response ---
  Status code: 200`
3. Visit your website again, you should see a new pledge!
4. Next to the `Delete Pledge` event click `Send Test` (and then `Send Test` again)
5. Visit your website again, the test pledge is gone!
